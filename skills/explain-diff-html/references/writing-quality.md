# Writing quality

This is the catalogue for step 6 of the workflow in `SKILL.md`. Give it to the
sub-agent that reads the draft cold, or run it inline when there is no
sub-agent.

The catalogue, trimmed to the tells that actually show up in a technical
explanation:

- Inflated significance. Calling the change pivotal, crucial, or a milestone.
  State what it does and let the reader judge.
- Promotional language. Seamless, robust, powerful, elegant, comprehensive.
- Overused AI vocabulary. Delve, leverage, utilize, underscore, showcase,
  navigate the complexities, it is worth noting, at its core, in the realm of.
- Superficial `-ing` analyses. A trailing clause that restates the sentence as
  significance: "improving performance and enhancing maintainability".
- Vague attribution. "Widely considered", "generally accepted", "many
  developers". Name the source or drop the claim.
- Negative parallelism. "Not only X but also Y", "It is not just A, it is B".
- Rule of three. Three-item lists and triple adjectives used as rhythm rather
  than because there are exactly three things.
- Em dash overuse. Use commas, periods, colons, or semicolons instead.
- Boldface overuse. Reserve it for a genuine warning. Headings carry structure.
- Filler. "It is important to note", "in order to", "at the end of the day".
- Hedge stacking. "May potentially somewhat", "could arguably tend to".
- Signposting. "In this section we will explore". Just explore it.
- Generic positive conclusion. A closing paragraph that praises the change and
  says nothing new.
- Reflexive systems metaphors. Orchestration, choreography, the beating heart,
  under the hood, plumbing, used as decoration rather than for a precise
  literal meaning.
- Invented compound terms. Coining a capitalised name for a concept the project
  does not name, then using it as though the reader knows it.

The tells above are about word choice. A page can pass every one of them and
still lose its reader through density, which is what a technical explanation
actually fails at. Ask for these too:

- Shorthand before its definition. A term the project uses freely, dropped in
  before the page says what it is. "Still set in italics the way value names
  are", where value name has not been introduced.
- An identifier cited but never named. Referring to a function only as
  `render.rs:157` while describing what it does, so the reader cannot connect
  the description to the name when the name finally appears. Name it where you
  first describe it.
- A back-reference reaching too far. "Both fall out of the render order below",
  pointing past three intervening examples. Either move the explanation closer
  or say where it is.
- Stacked noun phrases. "The flag-rendering match arms" reads more plainly as
  "the match arms that render each flag".
- Participial openers. "Marking the group required tells clap to reject..."
  becomes "A required group rejects...".
- Process-order narration. What you searched, tried, and found in the order it
  happened. The page carries the result.
- A fact with no consequence. A count or a diffstat that closes a section
  without telling the reader what it changes for them. Say what it means or cut
  it.
- Uniform sentence length. A long run of sentences at the same length reads as
  generated even when every one is correct. Vary them.

Write in the project's vocabulary, one idea per sentence, active voice with the
actor named, and the simplest word that carries the meaning.

Give a word one meaning per page. When a term already names something specific
in the explanation, do not reuse it for a second sense. On a page that discusses
test files, "test" belongs to those files, so a boolean condition is a check. The
reader cannot see your intent, only the word.

The sub-agent's prompt must also ask this, because it is what catches the
failures the catalogue misses:

- Is any sentence doing rhetorical work the evidence does not support? Name
  every place the page asserts a motive, an intent, a history, or a duration it
  has not shown. A phrase such as "this looked harmless for years" or "that is a
  deliberate extension point" reads as fact and is usually invention. Either
  quote the record that supports it or cut it. When the claim is the author's own
  inference, the page must say so.
- Where did you lose the thread, and which terms appear before they are
  introduced?
- Does Intuition give the core idea before the walkthrough starts, or does it
  ask the reader to take the central claim on trust until a later section?
